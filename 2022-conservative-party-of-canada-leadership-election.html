            In 2022, the Conservative Party of Canada held a leadership election to elect the successor to Erin O'Toole. He was removed on February 2, 2022, as leader by the party's caucus in the House of Commons of Canada by a vote of 73–45.<br/><br/>Five candidates were running for the position, including former Cabinet minister and Member of Parliament Pierre Poilievre, former Cabinet minister, former leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, and former Quebec Premier Jean Charest, Member of Parliament Leslyn Lewis, Member of Parliament Scott Aitchison, and Ontario Member of Provincial Parliament Roman Baber. Former member of parliament, former leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, and Brampton, Ontario Mayor Patrick Brown also ran for the position, but was disqualified in early July due to his campaign's alleged violations of the financial provisions of the Canada Elections Act.<br/><br/>On September 10, it was announced that Poilievre won the leadership on the first ballot. This was the party's first leadership election since 2004 which resulted in a first-ballot victory.<br/><br/>After the race, the whistleblower who alleged violation on Brown's campaign was revealed to have their legal fees paid by the Poilievre campaign. In addition, there have been reports that Patrick Brown's bid in the leadership race was a target of foreign interference from the Indian government, due to his affiliation with Khalistani-separatist groups based in Canada. In March 2025, The Globe and Mail reported that according to the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, Indian agents had done some organizing on behalf of Poilievre, though they did not have evidence that any senior Conservatives were aware.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>Following the 2021 Canadian federal election, the Conservative Party remained the Official Opposition with a loss of two seats, leaving it with 119 seats in the House of Commons.
