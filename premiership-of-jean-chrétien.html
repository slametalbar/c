            The premiership of Jean Chrétien began on November 4, 1993, when the first Cabinet headed by Jean Chrétien was sworn in by Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn. Chrétien was invited to form the 26th Canadian Ministry and become Prime Minister of Canada following the 1993 federal election, where Chrétien led his Liberal Party to win a majority of seats in the House of Commons of Canada, defeating the Progressive Conservative majority government of Prime Minister Kim Campbell. Chrétien led his Liberals to win two additional majorities in the federal elections of 1997 and 2000.<br/><br/>On December 12, 2003, Chrétien resigned as prime minister, being succeeded by his former finance minister, Paul Martin.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>A lawyer from Quebec, Jean Chrétien was elected as a Liberal to the House of Commons in the 1963 election. He served in the Cabinet of Prime Ministers Lester Pearson and Pierre Trudeau; some of his notable portfolios included minister of Indian affairs and northern development, president of the Treasury Board, minister of finance, and minister of justice. Chrétien contested the leadership of the Liberal Party to succeed Trudeau in the 1984 leadership election, but came in second place to his former Cabinet colleague John Turner. After Turner led the Liberals to two consecutive defeats in the 1984 and 1988 federal elections, Chrétien became leader of the Liberals in the 1990 leadership election. He led the party to a strong majority government in the 1993 federal election. He then led the party to two additional majorities in the elections of 1997 and 2000.
