            James Sinclair Ross, CM (January 22, 1908 – February 29, 1996) was a Canadian banker and author, who wrote novels and short fiction about life on the Canadian Prairies. He is best known for his first novel, As For Me and My House.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Life and career ==<br/><br/>Ross was born on a homestead near Shellbrook, Saskatchewan. When he was seven, his parents separated, and he lived with his mother on a number of different farms during his childhood, going to school in Indian Head, Saskatchewan. He left school after Grade 11 and in 1924 he joined the Union Bank of Canada, which became part of the Royal Bank of Canada a year later. At first, he worked in a number of small towns in Saskatchewan, then moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1933 where he wrote and published his most famous novel As For Me and My House. In 1946 he moved to Montreal, Quebec after spending four years in the Canadian Army during World War II. He remained with the Royal Bank until his retirement in 1968, after which he spent some time in Spain and Greece before moving to a nursing home in Vancouver, British Columbia, where he lived until his death.<br/><br/>As For Me and My House, set in an isolated town on the Prairies during the Great Depression, was published in 1941. At first not much noticed, it went on to become a Canadian literary classic and set the precedent for the genre of Canadian prairie fiction. He wrote three more novels during his lifetime, as well as a few anthologies of short stories, none of which became as well known as his first novel.
