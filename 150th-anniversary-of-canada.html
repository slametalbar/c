            The 150th anniversary of Canada, also known as the 150th anniversary of Confederation and promoted by the Canadian government as Canada 150, occurred in 2017 as Canada marked the sesquicentennial of Canadian Confederation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Planning ==<br/><br/>Major planning for the anniversary celebration began in 2010. The Institute of Public Administration of Canada held a conference called 150!Canada bringing together public servants, business leaders, and non-governmental organizations at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa on March 11 and 12, 2010. More than 300 delegates heard from 25 speakers, with the goal of developing an action to celebrate Canada's sesquicentennial.<br/><br/>The 150Alliance was established as a national network of groups with a goal to encourage communities and organizations to organize their own Canada 150 events. It held its first meeting in Ottawa on January 23, 2015.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Medal ===<br/><br/>As had been done in 1867, 1927, 1967, and 1992, a medal for the milestone anniversary of Confederation in 2017 was originally planned by Minister of Canadian Heritage Shelly Glover. She was succeeded in that office in 2015 by Melanie Joly, who received detailed information on the medal project up to that point, including a rendering of the design, prepared medal certificates, and drafted regulations and letters patent for Queen Elizabeth II's signature. However, Joly cancelled the medal in 2016, without stated reason.<br/><br/>The Senate commissioned the Royal Canadian Mint to cast honorary medallions commemorating the 150th anniversary of the upper chamber's first sitting.
