            Canada's cities span the continent of North America from east to west, but many of them are located relatively close to the border with the United States. Cities are home to the majority of Canada's approximately 35.75 million inhabitants (as of 2015)—just over 80 percent of Canadians lived in urban areas in 2006.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early urbanization: 14,000 BCE – 1850 CE ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Settlements and villages, 14,000 BCE – 1541 CE ===<br/><br/>During the Wisconsin glaciation 50,000-17,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed people to move across the Bering land bridge that joined Siberia to northwestern North America (Alaska). Alaska was ice-free because of low snowfall, allowing a small population to exist. The Laurentide Ice Sheet covered most of Canada, blocking nomadic inhabitants and confining them to Alaska (East Beringia) for thousands of years. Arriving in Canada around 16,500-13,000 years ago after initially inhabiting the territories of Alaska, archaeological evidence suggests that the Paleo-Indians' first "widespread" habitation of Canada and further south occurred during the last glacial period or, more specifically, what is known as the late glacial maximum. Yet Canada's first people did not build towns or cities upon arrival. They were few in number compared to the size of the North American continent and most lived a nomadic subsistence lifestyle, following the migration of animal herds that provided food.<br/><br/>Over time, Canada's First Nations started to construct different kinds of settlements, though they were generally temporary. For instance, the semi-nomadic peoples of the Maritimes, Quebec, and Northern Ontario, such as the Mi'kmaq, Cree, and Algonquin constructed temporary camps and villages with wigwams and long houses as the basic architecture of settlement.
