            The Canada Pension Plan (CPP; French: Régime de pensions du Canada) is a contributory, earnings-related social insurance program. It is one of the two major components of Canada's public retirement income system, the other being Old Age Security (OAS). Other parts of Canada's retirement system are private pensions, either employer-sponsored or from tax-deferred individual savings (known in Canada as a registered retirement savings plan). As of June 30, 2024, CPP Investments (CPPIB) manages over C$646 billion in investment assets for the Canada Pension Plan on behalf of 22 million Canadians. CPPIB is one of the world's largest pension funds.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Description ==<br/><br/>The CPP mandates all employed Canadians 18 years of age and over to contribute a prescribed portion of their earnings income (with an equal matching amount contributed by their employer) to a federally administered pension plan. The plan is administered by Employment and Social Development Canada on behalf of employees in all provinces and territories except Quebec, which operates an equivalent plan, the Quebec Pension Plan (Régime des rentes du Québec in French). Because the Constitutional authority for pensions is shared between the provincial and federal governments, stewardship for the CPP is jointly shared. As a result, major changes to the CPP (including those that alter how benefits are calculated) require the approval of at least seven Canadian provinces representing at least two-thirds of the country's population.<br/><br/>John Graham is the current CEO of the <br/><br/>CPP.<br/><br/>A province may choose to opt out of the Canada Pension Plan, as Quebec did in 1965, but must offer a comparable plan to its residents.: §3(1)  Any province may establish an additional or supplementary plan anytime, as under section 94A of the Canadian Constitution, pensions are a provincial responsibility.
