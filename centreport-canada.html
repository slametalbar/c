<h1>CentrePort Canada</h1>
            
            CentrePort Canada is a tri-modal dry port and Foreign Trade Zone located partly in northwest Winnipeg, Manitoba (CentrePort South) and partly in the Rural Municipality of Rosser (CentrePort North), and situated adjacent to the Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport (YWG). With 20,000 acres (81 km2) of industrial land, it is the largest tri-modal inland port and foreign trade zone in North America.<br/><br/>The port provides access to tri-modal transportation: (1) rail—three Class I railways, specifically Canadian National (CNR), Canadian Pacific (CPR), and BNSF Railway; (2) air—a 24/7 international air cargo airport; and (3) road—an international trucking hub. CentrePort also offers greenfield investment opportunities for a wide variety of business operations, including distribution, warehousing, and manufacturing. The portion of the inland port that falls within Rosser has access to a Special Planning Area to streamline the land development approval process.<br/><br/>CentrePort Canada Way is a 10 km (6.2 mi) expressway that links Winnipeg's Inkster Boulevard to the Perimeter Highway, and allows for 5 minutes to 90 km/h (56 mph). Located near the geographic centre of North America, it serves as a hub for national and international trading corridors, as well as attracting new transportation logistics development to the city area. Moreover, Winnipeg has direct connections to both of Canada's only major Pacific ports, Port of Vancouver and the Port of Prince Rupert, as well as a direct connection to Churchill, Manitoba, a major grain export facility and the only Canadian deep-water Arctic port.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Governance ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>CentrePort Canada was created in 2008 by provincial legislation called the CentrePort Canada Act, which established its mandate and designated land to the port. The Act also defines the structure of the board of directors and includes nominees from 11 nominating organizations and 4 directors at large.
