            The prime rate or prime lending rate is an interest rate used by banks, typically representing the rate at which they lend to their most creditworthy customers. Some variable interest rates may be expressed as a percentage above or below prime rate.: 8 <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Use in different banking systems ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== United States and Canada ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>Historically, in North American banking, the prime rate represented actual interest rate charged to borrowers, although this is no longer universally true. The prime rate varies little among banks and adjustments are generally made by banks at the same time, although this does not happen frequently. As of 25 February 2025, the prime rate was 7.50% in the United States and 5.20% in Canada.<br/><br/>In the United States, the prime rate runs approximately 300 basis points (or 3 percentage points) above the federal funds rate, which is the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans made to fulfill reserve funding requirements. The federal funds rate plus a much smaller increment is frequently used for lending to the most creditworthy borrowers, as is LIBOR, the London Interbank Offered Rate. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets eight times per year to set a target for the federal funds rate.<br/><br/>Prior to December 17, 2008, the Wall Street Journal followed a policy of changing its published prime rate when 23 out of 30 of the United States' largest banks changed their prime rates. Recognizing that fewer, larger banks now control most banking assets (that is, it is more concentrated), the Journal now publishes a rate reflecting the base rate posted by at least 70% of the top ten banks by assets.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Malaysia ===<br/><br/>Effective January 2, 2015, the Base Lending Rate (BLR) structure was replaced with a new Base Rate (BR) system.
