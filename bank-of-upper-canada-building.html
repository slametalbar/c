            The Bank of Upper Canada Building is a former bank building in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and one of the few remaining buildings in Toronto that predate the 1834 incorporation of the city. It is located at 252 Adelaide Street East (originally 28 Duke Street), in the Old Town district. Opened in 1827, in what was then the town of York, the building housed the Bank of Upper Canada until the bank's collapse in 1866. It was then used for school purposes and later for various commercial and industrial purposes before being restored in 1982 as commercial office space. The building has been designated a National Historic Site of Canada since 1977.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Description ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The limestone-clad building was completed in 1827 and originally had two storeys with a flat roof. The design is attributed to William Warren Baldwin, but it may have been designed by Francis Hall. The Doric portico, designed by John George Howard, was added in 1843.<br/><br/>Sometime after 1859, a new roof with dormers was added. In 1876, a mansard roof in the Second Empire style was added by the De La Salle Institute.
