            The Canada Savings Bond (French: Obligations d’épargne du Canada) was an investment instrument offered by the Government of Canada from 1945 to 2017, sold between early October and December 1 of every year. It was issued by the Bank of Canada and was intended to offer a competitive interest rate, and had a guaranteed minimum interest rate.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Canada started selling war bonds (marketed as "Victory Bonds") in 1917 to raise money during World War I for the Allies of World War I. Five bond campaigns were held from 1915 to 1919. To advertise the purchasing of Victory Bonds, the Victory Loan Dominion Publicity Committee created artwork, held parades, and had celebrity endorsements. Community members who bought many Victory Bonds were given a Victory Loan Honour Flag as a token of gratitude. The program was revived for World War II.<br/><br/>Canada Savings Bonds were first offered in 1945 in order to replicate the success of Victory Bonds.<br/><br/>In 2004, consultants gave the Department of Finance a report suggesting the CSB program be scrapped, giving an overall program cost savings of about $650 million in nine years. Then-finance minister Ralph Goodale rejected the recommendation as the program remained popular, especially with first-time investors, and opted to have the program changed to be more competitive and attract investors. <br/><br/>The value of bonds issued declined from $55 billion in 1987 to just over $6 billion in 2015.<br/><br/>A government-commissioned study by KPMG in June 2015 recommended cancelling the program.
