            Certain large banks are tracked and labelled by several authorities as Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs), depending on the scale and the degree of influence they hold in global and domestic financial markets.<br/><br/>Since 2011, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) has published a list of global SIFIs (G-SIFIs), while individual countries also maintain their own lists of Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs), also known in Europe as "national SIFIs" (N-SIFIs). In addition, special lists of regional systemically important banks (R-SIBs) also exist. The European Central Bank has separate criteria to designate credit institutions as "significant" under the framework of European Banking Supervision.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>In 2009, as a regulatory response to the revealed vulnerability of the banking sector in the 2008 financial crisis, and attempting to come up with a solution to solve the "too big to fail" interdependence between G-SIFIs and the economy of sovereign states, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) started to develop a method to identify G-SIFIs to which a set of stricter requirements would apply. The first publication of some leaked unofficial G-SIFI lists, during a time when the FSB identification method was still being tested and subject for subsequent adjustments, took place in November 2009 and November 2010. The first official version of the G-SIFI list was published by FSB in November 2011. The established nomenclature G-SIFI was supplemented and in large part replaced by the idea of a Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB) and has ever since been updated each year in November. This G-SIB list is the first one shown below.<br/><br/>All G-SIBs and D-SIBs with headquarters in the US and Europe are required each year to submit an updated emergency Resolution Plan to their Financial Supervision Authority.
