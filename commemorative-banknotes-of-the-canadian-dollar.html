The second commemorative banknote was the Centennial $1 banknote issued in January 1967 to commemorate the Canadian Centennial. The third was issued in September 2015 to commemorate Elizabeth II becoming the longest-reigning monarch of the United Kingdom and Canada. In 2017, the Bank of Canada released a commemorative $10 banknote for Canada's sesquicentennial, which was available by Canada Day.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Silver Jubilee of the accession of George V to the throne ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The first commemorative banknote issued by the Bank of Canada was a $25 banknote in the 1935 series to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of the accession of George V to the throne.
