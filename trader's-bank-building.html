            Trader's Bank Building is a 15-storey, 55.39 m (181.7 ft) early skyscraper (the first in Toronto), completed in 1906 at 67 Yonge Street in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The building was designed by Carrère and Hastings, with construction beginning in 1905. It was the tallest building in the British Commonwealth until the Royal Liver Building was completed in 1911. It remains one of Canada's few surviving skyscrapers of the early 20th century.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The building was assembled using two million bricks and 1700 tons of steel beams riveted using compressed air (with "millions" of rivets needed); once the foundations were finished, it was erected at a rate of about a floor a week.  The building was designed to be fireproof, thanks to the steel frame. In the event of a fire, fire doors would shut the elevators and staircases, with two large fire escapes in the rear. Steam heat on a vacuum system would warm the interior. Electric lights throughout and telephone cables on each floor were touted as features.<br/><br/>When described in a period newspaper, it was to have a flag pole 200 feet above street level and four high-speed elevators going up 187 feet.
