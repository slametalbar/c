            Canada and Cuba have established diplomatic relations with one another since 1945, following their centuries-old informal trading relationship. Informal trade relations were established between the colonies of Atlantic Canada and the Captaincy General of Cuba during the 18th century. The informal trade relationship continued into the 20th century until formal diplomatic relations was finally established.<br/><br/>Diplomatic relations between the two countries remain uninterrupted since its establishment, with Canada being one of only two countries in the Americas that did not sever relations with Cuba after the Cuban Revolution in 1959. Relations between Canada and Cuba have occasionally been a source of contention for Canada–United States relations.<br/><br/>Both countries maintain embassies in the other's capital city, in addition to consulates in other cities. The two countries also share a significant trading relationship with Cuba serving as Canada's second-largest export partner in the Caribbean/Central American region, and Canada serving as Cuba's third largest export market.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Trade relations between Canada and Cuba date back to the 18th century, with vessels from Atlantic Canada trading cod and beer for rum and sugar in Cuba.<br/><br/>After the United States terminated the Canadian–American Reciprocity Treaty in 1866, the governments of British North America sent trade missions throughout Latin America, including Cuba. The trade mission arrived in Cuba on 17 March 1866.
