            The Bank of Canada Building is the head office of the Bank of Canada. It is located at 234 Wellington Street in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Description ==<br/><br/>It was built from 1937-1938 by architect Sumner Godfrey Davenport of Montreal, Quebec, and completed by the Toronto-based firm of Marani, Lawson and Morris. The Bank of Canada Building replaced the Victoria Building to the east of this building on Wellington Street.<br/><br/>It is constructed of grey granite from Quebec. It is late neoclassical in style, which was a very popular style at the time for banks. The Bank of Canada Building won a number of architectural awards, including the Gold Medal from the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada.<br/><br/>The large bronze front doors were designed by Ulysses Ricci of New York, and decorated with facsimiles of Greek coins from the British Museum. The sculptures decorating the front facade were designed by Jacobine Jones, and they represent Canada's seven principal industries at the time: fishing, electricity, mining, agriculture, forestry, manufacturing, and construction. The cornerstone was placed by Prime Minister Mackenzie King and the Bank's first governor, Graham Towers.
