            The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is an international financial institution which is owned by member central banks. Its primary goal is to foster international monetary and financial cooperation while serving as a bank for central banks. With its establishment in 1930 it is the oldest international financial institution. Its initial purpose was to oversee the settlement of World War I war reparations.<br/><br/>The BIS carries out its work through its meetings, programmes and through the Basel Process, hosting international groups pursuing global financial stability and facilitating their interaction. It also provides banking services, but only to central banks and other international organizations.<br/><br/>The BIS is based in Basel, Switzerland, with representative offices in Hong Kong and Mexico City.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Background ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>International monetary cooperation started to develop tentatively in the course of the 19th century. An early case was a £400,000 loan in gold coins, in 1825 and facilitated by the Rothschilds, from the Bank of France to the Bank of England, which was facing a bank run. The Bank of England again borrowed from its French counterpart (and from the Hamburger Bank) in 1836 and 1839, and lent to it in return in 1847.
