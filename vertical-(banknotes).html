            The eighth series of banknotes of the Canadian dollar was first released by the Bank of Canada in 2018. Like the preceding 2011 Frontier series, the 2018 series consists of polymer banknotes designed for increased durability and to incorporate more security features. It is the first series issued by the Bank of Canada printed in a vertical configuration.<br/><br/>The banknotes were designed by the Canadian Bank Note Company, which also prints the banknotes. The first note, the $10 bill featuring Viola Desmond, was revealed on International Women's Day, 8 March 2018, and was released to the public on 19 November 2018. Future notes will come at a slower pace than previous series to allow technological innovations to be worked into their design as time goes on.<br/><br/>The $10 note is the first Canadian banknote in history to possess a vertical orientation; future banknotes of other denominations (such as the $5, $20 and $50 notes) are expected to share the similar vertical orientation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== $5 note ==<br/><br/>In January 2020, the Bank of Canada confirmed it would begin soliciting suggestions for the historic Canadian who would replace Wilfrid Laurier on the $5 note. The Bank of Canada released a shortlist of candidates under consideration for the bill in November 2020 which included figures such as Pitseolak Ashoona, Won Alexander Cumyow, Terry Fox, and others. In accordance with the Bank of Canada Act, the Minister of Finance will make the final decision and the name of the individual selected will be announced thereforth.
