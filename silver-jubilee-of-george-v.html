            The Silver Jubilee of George V on 6 May 1935 marked 25 years of George V as the King of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions, and Emperor of India. The Jubilee was marked with large-scale and popular events throughout London and the rest of the United Kingdom in May 1935. It was the first ever Silver Jubilee celebration of a British monarch in history. The King died less than a year later.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Celebrations ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Silver Jubilee Celebrations in London began with a carriage procession through the City to St Paul's Cathedral for a national service of thanksgiving on 6 May 1935. It was followed by another procession back to Buckingham Palace, where the royal family appeared on the balcony. The King and Queen were joined by members of the Royal Family, including Queen Maud of Norway, the Prince of Wales, the Duke and Duchess of York, the Princess Royal and the Earl of Harewood, the Duke of Gloucester, and the Duke and Duchess of Kent. Due to popular demand, the King waved from the same balcony for a few consecutive days later in the same week.<br/><br/>The Jubilee day was declared a bank holiday and celebrations were held across the United Kingdom with garden parties, pageants and sports events. At 8 pm, the King's Jubilee speech was broadcast.
