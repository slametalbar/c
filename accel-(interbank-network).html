            Accel (formerly known as the ACCEL/Exchange Network) is a North American interbank network owned by Fiserv. It connects over 412,000 automatic teller machines (ATMs) in all 50 states in the United States. The network also has a small number of ATMs in certain U.S. Air Force Bases around the world, and over 3.3 million electronic funds transfer at point-of-sale locations.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>1985: Accel was founded, by major banks in the Northwest of the United States, primarily as an electronic funds transfer network.<br/><br/>1991: Accel began a business partnership with the Exchange network creating ACCEL/Exchange.<br/><br/>In the 1990s most banks in the Pacific Northwest were part of this network including Seafirst Bank/Bank of America, US Bank, First Interstate Bank, Puget Sound Bank, Rainier Bank/Security Pacific, Key Bank and West One Bank.  Since then, bank mergers caused some banks to leave the Accel/Exchange network.  Now only Key Bank is part of Accel/Exchange when it comes to major banks in the Northwest.<br/><br/>2013: In April, the company streamlined the name from "ACCEL/Exchange" to simply "Accel," a result of a repositioning of the debit payment network, and a reflection of its current "ability to accelerate funds transfers across retail, biller and social person-to-person payments. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== The Exchange Network ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Accel's Canadian counterpart, known as THE EXCHANGE Network (and stylized as THE EXCHANGE), is operated by FICANEX, a limited partnership of several Canadian banks and credit unions which licenses "THE EXCHANGE" branding and intellectual property from Fiserv.
