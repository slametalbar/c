            Banknotes that are no longer in issue in Canada, and are being removed from circulation, are said to be "withdrawn from circulation".<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Current issues ==<br/><br/>The Bank of Canada, Canada's sole issuer of bank notes, currently issues five different denominations ($5, $10, $20, $50 and $100). Smaller denominations have been replaced by coins, and larger ones are felt to be no longer required in an era of electronic transmission of most large transactions. There are no plans to re-issue Canadian banknotes larger than $100.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Defunct currency ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Notes issued by these former issuing authorities are considered to be withdrawn from circulation:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Colonial governments, prior to each entering confederation.<br/><br/>The Dominion of Canada between 1870 and 1935, which issued notes in denominations of 25¢, $1, $2, $4, $5, $50, $100, $500, and $1,000<br/><br/>Canadian chartered banks, from  pre-Confederation to 1944. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Bank of Canada notes ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>All Bank of Canada notes issued prior to the current Frontier Series are being withdrawn from circulation. The following Bank of Canada denominations included in previous series have been permanently retired, and as of January 1, 2021, these notes are no longer legal tender:<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== $25 ===<br/><br/>The $25 note was issued only in 1935, to commemorate the silver jubilee of King George V. As with other 1935 issues, separate English and French versions were printed. This was a limited release that was never printed in large quantities. The note was coloured an appropriate royal purple; both the King &amp; his consort Queen Mary were featured, with Windsor Castle appearing on the back.
