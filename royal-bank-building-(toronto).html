            The Royal Bank Building refers to two office buildings constructed for the Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto financial district in Ontario, Canada:The first building is a  20-storey structure situated on the  northeast corner of Yonge and King Streets. It was completed in 1915 and designed by the architectural firm Ross and Macdonald.  The City of Toronto recognized its historical significance by  designating  it  under the Ontario Heritage Act in 1976. It is also commonly referred to by its municipal address, 2 King Street East.   Standing at 90 meters tall, the building was the tallest in Canada until 1928.<br/><br/>The second building also known as the 12-storey Royal Bank Building, located at 20 King Street West between Yonge and Bay Streets, served as the bank's Toronto offices until the Royal Bank Plaza was completed in 1977. This building was designed by architects Marani, Morris, &amp; Allen. It is still one of several buildings in Toronto's downtown core occupied by the Royal Bank.  Construction on the building commenced with the laying of the cornerstone by then Royal Bank of Canada Chairman James Allan in 1964.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== References ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>TO Built - 2 King Street East<br/><br/>TO Built - Royal Bank Building<br/><br/>"Royal Bank Building".
