            First Canadian Place is a skyscraper in the Financial District of Toronto, Ontario, at the northwest corner of King and Bay streets, and serves as the global operational executive office of the Bank of Montreal. At 298 m (978 ft), it is the tallest building in Canada, the 34th tallest building in North America, and the 243rd tallest in the world. It is also the third tallest free-standing structure in Canada, after the CN Tower (also in Toronto) and the Inco Superstack chimney (projected to be demolished) in Sudbury, Ontario. The building is owned by Manulife Financial Corporation (50 per cent) in addition to a private consortium of investors including CPP Investments. The building is managed by Brookfield Properties.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History and architecture ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>First Canadian Place is named for Canada's first bank, the Bank of Montreal. The main building in the complex was intended to be known as "First Canadian Bank Tower." Designed by B+H Architects with Edward Durell Stone as a design consultant, construction was completed in 1975.<br/><br/>The tower and associated buildings occupy a block once home to two major newspapers, the Toronto Star’s Toronto Star Building and The Globe and Mail's William H. Wright Building. The site was the last of the corners at King and Bay to be redeveloped in the 1960s and 1970s, and a major bidding war began over the property. The then-little-known firm of Olympia and York eventually obtained nearly the whole city block, but the election of reformist mayor David Crombie led to new rules banning skyscrapers.
