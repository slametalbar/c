            An Order in Council is a type of legislation in many countries, especially the Commonwealth realms. In the United Kingdom, this legislation is formally made in the name of the monarch by and with the advice and consent of the Privy Council (King-in-Council); however, in other countries, the terminology may vary. Orders-in-Council are distinct from Orders of Council, which are made in the name of the Council without sovereign approval.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Types, usage and terminology ==<br/><br/>There are two principal types of order in council: orders in council whereby the King-in-Council exercises the royal prerogative, and orders in council made in accordance with an act of Parliament.<br/><br/>In the United Kingdom, orders are formally made by the monarch with the advice of the Privy Council (King-in-Council or Queen-in-Council). In Canada, federal orders in council are made in the name of the Governor General by the King's Privy Council for Canada; provincial orders-in-council are of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council by the provincial Executive Council. In other places in name of the governor by the executive council (Governor-in-Council, Governor-General-in-Council, etc.).<br/><br/>In New Zealand, the orders in council, undertaken by the Executive Council, are required to give effect to the government's decisions. Apart from acts of Parliament, orders in council are the main method by which the government implements decisions that need legal force.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Prerogative orders ===<br/><br/>An order in council made under the royal prerogative does not depend on any statute for its authority, although an act of Parliament may change this.
