            The Canadian silver dollar (French: Dollar argent du Canada) was first issued by the Royal Canadian Mint in 1935 to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of King George V. The coin's reverse design was sculpted by Emanuel Hahn and portrays a voyageur and a person of Indigenous descent paddling a birch-bark canoe. The faint lines in the background represent the Northern Lights. The voyageur design was used on the dollar until 1986. It was then replaced with the 1987 Canadian 1-dollar coin (colloquially known as the "loonie"). 1967 marked the end of the silver dollar as a business strike, or a coin issued for circulation. After 1967, the dollar coin was made of nickel, except for non-circulating commemorative issues for the collector market, which continue to contain silver.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Varieties ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== 1911 ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>While the silver dollar was not struck for production in 1911, three trial strikes were produced by the Royal Mint in London: two struck in silver and one in lead. Since these coins were unique and not intended for circulation, they have been classified as pattern coins. One of the silver coins, owned by the Royal Mint Museum, has been loaned to the Bank of Canada since 1976 and has been displayed in the Bank of Canada Museum since 1980. The lead coin was not discovered until 1977, during an office move from Parliament Hill.
