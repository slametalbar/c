<h1>Neutral rate of interest</h1>
            
            The neutral or natural rate of interest is the real (net of inflation) interest rate that supports the economy at full employment/maximum output while keeping inflation constant.  It cannot be observed directly.  Rather, policy makers and economic researchers aim to estimate the neutral rate of interest as a guide to monetary policy, usually using various economic models to help them do so.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk used the term "natural interest" in his Capital and Interest first written in 1880s, but the concept itself was originated by the Swedish economist Knut Wicksell. Wicksell published a study in 1898 defining the natural rate of interest as the rate that would bring an economy in aggregate price equilibrium if all lending were done without reference to money. Wicksell defined the natural rate of interest as "a certain rate of interest on loans which is neutral in respect to commodity prices and tends neither to raise nor to lower them".<br/><br/>Following Wicksell, J. M. Keynes introduced the term "natural rate of interest" in his A Treatise on Money (1930).<br/><br/>No further significant work on the idea of a natural rate of interest followed, partly because Wicksell's study was originally published in German and did not become easily available in English until 1936. Further, at the time, central banks were not targeting interest rates. The level of interest rates was not a main focus of policy attention.
