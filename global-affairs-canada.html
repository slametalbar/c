            Global Affairs Canada (GAC; French: Affaires mondiales Canada; AMC) is the department of the Government of Canada that manages Canada's diplomatic and consular relations, promotes Canadian international trade, and leads Canada's international development and humanitarian assistance. It is also responsible for maintaining Canadian government offices abroad with diplomatic and consular status on behalf of all government departments.<br/><br/>According to the OECD, Canada's total official development assistance (ODA) (US$7.8 billion, preliminary data) increased in 2022 due to exceptional support to Ukraine and its pandemic response in developing countries, increased costs for in-donor refugees as well as higher contributions to international organizations, representing 0.37% of gross national income (GNI).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The department has undergone numerous name changes and re-organizations since its founding in 1909. Originally established as the "Department of External Affairs", GAC has been known by a variety of names throughout its lifetime. Its current legal name is the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development, but its "applied" name used within government is Global Affairs Canada often shorted in the Canadian media to simply "Global Affairs".<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Origins (early 20th century) ===<br/><br/>GAC was first founded as the Department of External Affairs on 1 June 1909.<br/><br/>During and after World War I, Canada assumed greater control over its foreign relations, with its full autonomy in this field confirmed by the Statute of Westminster in 1931. For historical reasons, the name External Affairs was retained.<br/><br/>The Department of Trade and Commerce, which included the Trade Commissioner Service, had been created in 1892.
