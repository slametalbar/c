            The Schulich School of Business is the business school of York University located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The institution provides undergraduate and graduate degree and diploma programs in business administration, finance, accounting, business analytics, public administration and international business as well as a number of PhD and executive programs. Originally known as the Faculty of Administrative Studies (FAS), it was renamed in 1995 after Seymour Schulich, a major benefactor who has donated $15 million to the school. The Dean of the School, Detlev Zwick, was appointed in 2021 after having served as Interim Dean for 15 months.<br/><br/>Primarily located at the Seymour Schulich Building on the Keele Campus in Toronto, Ontario, the school maintains an executive education centre in Toronto's Financial District and satellite campuses in Hyderabad, India, and Beijing, China. The school has satellite centres in Shanghai, Mumbai, Seoul, São Paulo, and Mexico City. Schulich offers undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate business degrees. Schulich pioneered Canada's first International MBA (IMBA) and International BBA (iBBA) degrees, as well as the Kellogg-Schulich Executive MBA.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The Schulich School of Business was known as the Faculty of Administrative Studies which was founded in 1966. Before the establishment of the Seymour Schulich Building on the Keele Campus in 2003, the school was run from a York University building, currently renamed as Health, Nursing &amp; Environmental Studies Building. In 1995, following a major monetary donation from Canadian billionaire Seymour Schulich, the school underwent a series of changes that created the present-day Schulich School of Business.
