            Bank One Corporation was an American bank founded in 1968 and at its peak the sixth-largest bank in the United States. It traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock symbol ONE. The company merged with JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. on July 1, 2004, with Bank One CEO Jamie Dimon soon becoming CEO and Chairman of the combined company but under JPMorgan Chase branding. The company had its headquarters in the Bank One Plaza (now Chase Tower) in the Chicago Loop in Chicago, Illinois, now the headquarters of Chase's retail banking division.<br/><br/>Bank One traces its roots to the merger of Illinois based First Chicago NBD, and  Ohio-based First Banc Group (later Bank One),  a holding company for the City National Bank in Columbus, Ohio.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== First Banc Group ===<br/><br/>The First Banc Group, Inc. was formed in 1968 as a holding company for City National Bank and was used as a vehicle to acquire other banks. As Ohio began to gradually relax its very restrictive Great Depression era banking laws that had severely restricted bank branching and ownership, City National Bank, through its First Banc Group parent, started to purchase banks outside of its home county. The first acquisition by the new bank holding company was the 1968 acquisition of the Farmers Saving &amp; Trust Company in Mansfield, Ohio. With each acquisition, new member banks kept their name, employees, and management while obtaining new resources from the parent holding company.
