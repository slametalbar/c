            Several independent candidates campaigned as candidates in the 2004 federal election, representing a variety of political viewpoints and ambitions.  One independent candidate, Chuck Cadman, was elected.  Information about another candidates may be found on this page.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Ontario ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Rosie the Clown Elston (Kingston and the Islands) ===<br/><br/>Rosie the Clown is the stage name of Laura Elston. She was 46 years old at the time of the election, and had been performing as Rosie in Ottawa and Kingston for fifteen years. She campaigned in a red wig, jumpsuit and face paint, in a novelty candidacy influenced by groups like the defunct Rhinoceros Party of Canada. She announced her candidacy by saying, "I've just been thinking wouldn't it be nice to lighten up just a little bit. The issues are serious, and it's a very momentous time and a difficult time for the world, but I find that when we get too totally stressed out and we take ourselves too seriously, we don't decide well about the serious issues." (Kingston Whig-Standard, 7 June 2004)<br/><br/>Elston was an aide to local Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Flora MacDonald for two years in the 1980s (KWS, 23 June 2004). She received 237 votes (0.44%), finishing sixth against Liberal incumbent Peter Milliken.<br/><br/>Elston should not be confused with Vicki Gabereau, who campaigned for Mayor of Toronto under the pseudonym of clown "Rosie Sunrise" in 1974 (Toronto Star, 23 January 2003).
