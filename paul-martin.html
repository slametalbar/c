            Paul Edgar Philippe Martin  (born August 28, 1938), also known as Paul Martin Jr., is a Canadian lawyer and politician who served as the 21st prime minister of Canada and the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada from 2003 to 2006.<br/><br/>The son of former senator and secretary of state for external affairs Paul Martin Sr., Martin was a lawyer from Ontario before he became president and the chief executive officer of Canada Steamship Lines in 1973. He held that position until his election as a member of Parliament for the Montreal riding of LaSalle—Émard in 1988. Martin ran for leader of the Liberal Party in 1990, losing to Jean Chrétien. Martin would become Chrétien's longtime rival for the leadership of the party, though was appointed his minister of finance after the Liberal victory in the 1993 federal election. Martin oversaw many changes in the financial structure of the Canadian government, and his policies had a direct effect on eliminating the country's chronic fiscal deficit by drastically cutting spending and reforming various programs including social services. In 2002, Martin resigned as finance minister when tensions with Chrétien reached their peak. Martin initially prepared to challenge Chrétien's leadership; however, Chrétien announced his intention of retiring, which triggered the November 2003 leadership election. Martin easily won the leadership and was sworn in as prime minister in December. <br/><br/>In the 2004 federal election, the Liberal Party retained power as a minority government, losing its majority due to the sponsorship scandal that began to develop in the late 1990s.
