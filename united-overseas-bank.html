            United Overseas Bank Limited (simplified Chinese: 大华银行有限公司; traditional Chinese: 大華銀行有限公司; pinyin: Dàhuá Yínháng Yǒuxìan Gōngsī; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Tāi-hôa Gûn-hâng Iú-hān Kong-si), often known as UOB, is a Singaporean regional bank headquartered at Raffles Place, Singapore, with branches mostly found in Southeast Asia countries. <br/><br/>It is one of the three "big local banks" in the country, the other two being DBS Bank and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC).<br/><br/>First Founded during the Great Depression in 1935 as United Chinese Bank (UCB) by a group of Hoklo businessmen including Sarawak-born Wee Kheng Chiang, the bank operated from a single branch bank in rented premises of Bonham Building, located in Boat Quay, close to the Singapore River. It was principally engaged in short-term loans to a segment of local businessmen, to be precise, Hokkien Chinese businessmen in Singapore.<br/><br/>UOB is the third largest bank in Southeast Asia by total assets. The bank provides personal financial services, commercial banking, private banking and asset management services, as well as corporate finance, venture capital and insurance services. It has 68 branches in Singapore and a network of more than 500 offices in 19 countries and territories in Asia Pacific, Western Europe and North America.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>On 6 August 1935, Sarawak-born businessman Wee Kheng Chiang, together with six other partners, established the bank with a paid-up capital of S$1 million. The bank was originally incorporated as United Chinese Bank (UCB) and served the mainly Hokkien Chinese community in Singapore. Wee, being the largest shareholder, became its first chairman.
