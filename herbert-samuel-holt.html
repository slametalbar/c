            Sir Herbert Samuel Holt (February 12, 1855 – September 28, 1941) was an Irish-born Canadian civil engineer who became a businessman, banker, and corporate director. He was President of the Royal Bank of Canada, Montreal Light, Heat &amp; Power, and a director of some 250 companies worldwide, with assets valued at around $200 million. On his death, the Montreal Gazette described him as "the richest man in Canada", but he was also one of the most reviled. Among his peers in the Golden Square Mile, his ruthless business reputation ensured that "everyone respected his business ability, but nobody liked him personally". Holt was one of the founders of the Town of Hampstead, Quebec.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Holt was born at Ballycrystal, near Geashill, County Offaly. He was the second son of William Robert Grattan Holt, of Carberry House, County Kildare, inherited in 1742 from his ancestor, Hannah Colley (afterwards Grattan) of Castle Carberry. Holt grew up with his family at another family property, Ballycrystal, a grazing farm of 291 acres. In reference to Holt's own ruthless business reputation, it is of interest to note that in a dispute between his father and his uncle, it was said that "the business affairs of William Holt's family would not stand up to close scrutiny." Herbert Holt's elder brother, Thomas Grattan Holt, succeeded to Ballycrystal and Carberry, while Holt studied civil engineering in Dublin. In 1873, he emigrated to Canada, beginning work as an assistant engineer with the Toronto Water Works.
