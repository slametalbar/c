            Fiat money is a type of government-issued currency that is not backed by a precious metal, such as gold or silver, nor by any other tangible asset or commodity. Fiat currency is typically designated by the issuing government to be legal tender, and is authorized by government regulation. Since the end of the Bretton Woods system in 1976 by the Jamaica Accords, the major currencies in the world are fiat money.<br/><br/>Fiat money generally does not have intrinsic value and does not have use value. It has value only because the individuals who use it as a unit of account –  or, in the case of currency, a medium of exchange –  agree on its value. They trust that it will be accepted by merchants and other people as a means of payment for liabilities.<br/><br/>Fiat money is an alternative to commodity money, which is a currency that has intrinsic value because it contains, for example, a precious metal such as gold or silver which is embedded in the coin. Fiat also differs from representative money, which is money that has intrinsic value because it is backed by and can be converted into a precious metal or another commodity. Fiat money can look similar to representative money (such as paper bills), but the former has no backing, while the latter represents a claim on a commodity (which can be redeemed to a greater or lesser extent).<br/><br/>Government-issued fiat money banknotes were used first during the 13th century in China.
