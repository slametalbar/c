            Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED; French: Innovation, Sciences et Développement économique Canada; ISDE) is a department of the Government of Canada. ISED is responsible for a number of the federal government's functions in regulating industry and commerce, promoting science and innovation, and supporting economic development. The department was known as Industry Canada (IC) prior to 2015.<br/><br/>The department is led by the minister of innovation, science and industry (currently François-Philippe Champagne), who also serves as the registrar general of Canada and is responsible for the department to Parliament. Several other ministerial portfolios are associated with the department. While the minister is head of the department, and provides policy/political direction, the day-to-day operations of the department are managed by the deputy minister, who is a public servant. The department headquarters are located at the C.D. Howe Building at 235 Queen Street in Ottawa, Ontario.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The Department of Trade and Commerce was created in statute on 23 June 1887 and proclaimed into force on 3 December 1892. In 1969, the department was replaced by the Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce, which itself was replaced in 1990 by Industry, Science and Technology. This new department also absorbed the offices of Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion and Minister of State for Science and Technology, marking the inclusion of regional approaches and scientific emphasis in the development of Canadian industries.
